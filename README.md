Refactor: Implement local storage service and enhance user management

This commit introduces a refactor to the codebase, focusing on implementing a new local storage service and enhancing user management across the application. The key changes are as follows:

1. Refactoring App Settings
   - Replaced direct usage of `SharedPreferences` in `AppSettings` with a new `LocalStorageService` for more modular and testable code.
   - Updated methods to use the new local storage service (`setIsDark`, `setAdminChecked`).

2. New LocalStorageService Added
   - Created `lib/common/storage/local_storage_service.dart` to encapsulate all local storage operations, including:
     - Theme settings (`isDark`, `setIsDark`).
     - Admin check status (`adminChecked`, `setAdminChecked`).
     - User caching (`setCachedUser`, `getCachedUser`, `clearCachedUser`).

3. Updates to SignIn and SignUp Controllers
   - Refactored `SignInController` and `SignUpController` to use `pageStore` instead of `signUpStore` for improved readability and consistency.
   - Enhanced the controllers to utilize the newly introduced `LocalStorageService` for better state management.

4. Enhanced User Store with Local Caching
   - Modified `UserStore` to use `LocalStorageService` for caching the current user and maintaining user session state.
   - Added methods for retrieving the current user from local storage or Firestore if not found locally.

5. Firestore and Firebase Auth Repository Enhancements
   - Introduced constants for Firestore collection and document names to improve maintainability and reduce hardcoded strings.
   - Updated `FirebaseAuthRepository` to integrate with local storage checks for the first user admin setup.

6. UI and Page Logic Updates
   - Adjusted `SignInPage` and `SignUpPage` to work with the updated controller logic, ensuring correct usage of stores and state management.
   - Improved the UI flow by utilizing cached user data where applicable to enhance user experience and reduce redundant network calls.

7. Dependency Injection Setup Updates
   - Updated `locator.dart` to register the new `LocalStorageService` as a singleton, ensuring consistent usage across the application.

8. Removed Deprecated or Unused Files
   - Deleted obsolete files like `firebase_storage_repository.dart` and `sign_up_store.dart` under `auth` to clean up the codebase.

These changes collectively improve the overall code structure, enhance modularity, and optimize user management and state handling across the Flutter application.
