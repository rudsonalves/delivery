## 2024/10/09 - version: 0.6.20+42

This commit focuses on refactoring the way deliverymen's geolocation data is managed. The core goal is to replace the `LocationService` class with a new repository structure that offers a more modular and repository-oriented approach to handling deliverymen's data and location services.

### Major Changes and Refactoring

1. **Introduction of `DeliverymenFirebaseRepository`**:
   - Created a new repository class, `DeliverymenFirebaseRepository`, that directly manages CRUD operations for deliverymen data within Firebase.
   - Implemented functions to handle the addition (`add`) and update (`updateLocation`) of deliverymen data in Firestore, simplifying location management.

2. **Abstracted Location Management**:
   - Introduced an abstract class, `AbstractDeliverymenRepository`, which provides an interface for deliverymen operations such as obtaining the current location and updating deliverymen details.
   - Removed the `LocationService` class entirely, as its responsibilities have now been distributed and refactored into the repository pattern.

3. **User Delivery Controller Refactoring**:
   - Updated the `UserDeliveryController` to use `DeliverymenFirebaseRepository` instead of the previous `LocationService`.
   - Refactored methods for creating and updating deliverymen location to utilize the new repository methods, improving separation of concerns.

### Detailed Changes

1. **`lib/features/user_delivery/user_delivery_controller.dart`**

- Removed the import for `LocationService` and added imports for `AbstractDeliverymenRepository` and `DeliverymenFirebaseRepository`.
- Replaced all instances where `locationService` was used with appropriate methods from `deliverymenRepository`.
- Removed direct calls to location services and used the repository to handle location updates and creation.

2. **New File: `lib/repository/firebase_store/abstract_deliverymen_repository.dart`**

- Created an abstract class `AbstractDeliverymenRepository` to define the contract for operations involving deliverymen, including getting the current location, adding, and updating deliverymen in Firestore.
- This abstraction allows for better flexibility and testability, adhering to dependency inversion principles.

3. **New File: `lib/repository/firebase_store/deliverymen_firebase_repository.dart`**

- Implemented the `DeliverymenFirebaseRepository` class, which extends `AbstractDeliverymenRepository`.
- Handles all Firebase-related operations for deliverymen, including:
  - **Getting Current Location**: Implements permissions handling and uses the `Geolocator` package to get the user's current position.
  - **Adding Deliverymen**: Adds new deliverymen entries with geolocation data to Firebase.
  - **Updating Deliverymen Location**: Updates existing deliverymen's geolocation data in Firebase.
- This class serves as the new centralized point for managing deliverymen data in Firestore, providing a more maintainable and structured approach.

4. **Removed File: `lib/services/location_service.dart`**

- Deleted the `LocationService` class as its responsibilities were moved into `DeliverymenFirebaseRepository`.
- This removal simplifies the codebase by centralizing the deliverymen-related logic within the repository layer.

### Conclusion

This refactoring improves code maintainability, testability, and follows best practices for modular design by adopting the repository pattern for managing deliverymen's geolocation data. The new structure aligns well with scalable software architecture, making future changes and extensions easier to manage.

       - `sign_up_store.g.dart` ‚Üí `pages/sign_up_store.g.dart`
     - **Explanation:**
       - The MobX stores were relocated from the `mobx` directory to a new `pages` directory within `stores` to better organize store files based on their associated features or pages.
       - All import statements within the project were updated to reflect the new file paths.

3. **User Model Enhancements (`lib/common/models/user.dart`)**
   
   - **Imported Material Symbols Icons:**
     
     - **Before:**
       
       ```dart
       import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
       ```
     
     - **After:**
       
       ```dart
       import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
       import 'package:material_symbols_icons/material_symbols_icons.dart';
       ```
     
     - **Explanation:**
       
       - Added the `material_symbols_icons` package to utilize a broader range of icons, enhancing the UI's visual appeal.
   
   - **Updated Icon Assignments:**
     
     - **Before:**
       
       ```dart
       case UserRole.admin:
         title = 'Administrador';
         icon = Icons.admin_panel_settings_rounded;
         break;
       // ...
       case UserRole.business:
         title = 'Comerciante';
         icon = Icons.person_rounded;
         break;
       case UserRole.manager:
         title = 'Gerente';
         icon = Icons.manage_accounts_outlined;
         break;
       ```
     
     - **After:**
       
       ```dart
       case UserRole.admin:
         title = 'Administrador';
         icon = Symbols.admin_panel_settings_rounded;
         break;
       // ...
       case UserRole.business:
         title = 'Comerciante';
         icon = Symbols.business;
         break;
       case UserRole.manager:
         title = 'Gerente';
         icon = Symbols.manage_accounts_rounded;
         break;
       default:
         title = 'Clique para entrar';
         icon = Symbols.people_rounded;
         break;
       ```
     
     - **Explanation:**
       
       - Replaced standard `Icons` with `Symbols` from the `material_symbols_icons` package for a more consistent and modern iconography.
       - Added a `default` case to handle scenarios where the user role might not match any predefined roles, providing a fallback title and icon.

8. **Store Files Renaming**
   
   - **Renaming Stores from `mobx` to `pages`:**
     - All store files within `lib/stores/mobx/` have been renamed to reside within `lib/stores/pages/`. This includes both the Dart files and their corresponding generated `.g.dart` files.
     - **Example:**
       - `lib/stores/mobx/add_client_store.dart` ‚Üí `lib/stores/pages/add_client_store.dart`
       - `lib/stores/mobx/add_client_store.g.dart` ‚Üí `lib/stores/pages/add_client_store.g.dart`
     - **Explanation:**
       - This renaming improves the organizational structure of the project by categorizing stores based on their association with specific pages or features, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

9. **Additional Notes**
   
   - **Typographical Correction:**
     - The filename `add_cliend_page.dart` appears to contain a typo. It should likely be renamed to `add_client_page.dart` to maintain consistency and prevent potential import issues.
   - **Consistency in Enum Usage:**
     - Ensured that enums `PageState` and `ZipStatus` are consistently used across all stores, promoting uniform state management.
   - **Iconography Enhancement:**
     - Transitioned from using standard Flutter `Icons` to `Symbols` from the `material_symbols_icons` package for a more modern and consistent icon set across the application.

These changes collectively enhance the project's structure, improve code maintainability, and ensure consistency in state management and utility functions across different features. The refactoring also paves the way for easier scalability and integration of new features in the future.
